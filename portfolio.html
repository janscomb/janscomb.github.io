			<p class="portfolioContent">
			This precription kiosk project was two-faceted. One project goal was to have a kiosk in Target stores near the pharmacy that a shopper could use to look up, or renew a prescription without getting in line. The other goal was to have an employee portal that would allow employees to view their benefits, contributions, and more.

Imagine you just got a raise at work, and you are currently enrolled in a 401k plan where your employer matches a certain percent. This benefits AI would interact with you with this knowledge on your next login.

			Caring for many patients has got to be a hard job. This project took me to new levels of empathy - really attempting to put myself in the shoes of a resident physician in a busy hostpital. You start your morning checking updates since the last shift left. Then you start your rounds (called "rounding"). Each patient's chart needs reviewing and approval with notes to be made on each stop. Seems like a lot, and you haven't even gotten to lunch.

			Mutare created an app for hospital alerts. This was a simple, and quick way for physicians, nurses, and administrators to send immediate cross-department alerts for everything you could think of. From code blues to tornado warnings. With immediate push notification, this replaced the old beeper and paging systems that were far outdated, but surprisingly, still in use.

			Accretive Health began a new campaign to be more engaged, and in turn, get their users (patients with chronic conditions) more engaged in their health. The idea is simple; keep in front of patients with data and education on their conditions, have a place they can go, and people to speak with about their condition, keep them from getting worse or having emergency room visits, and finally, easy ways to track their progress.

			Coordinated Care is essentially a team of physicians across departments, specialties, companies, locations, etc. working together to give the best possible care for a patient. Kicked off by the Affordable Care Act, federal law stated that a company offering, say, a surgery, is responsible for their care even after they leave their immediate care and go on to Physical Therapy, Home Health, or any other service.

			<p class="portfolioContent">
			The Population Health software is a data-driven platform that takes SMS mobile survey response data and looks for inconsistencies or downward trends to evaluate patient conditions. This initial platform was created for the Cleveland Clinic for patients with Asthma. If the trend reached a specifically set low marker, the patient would be placed into a call center queue and a representative at the clinic would call them to check on them.

			<p class="portfolioContent">
			The PinpointCare patient engagement platform was user-centered experience to notify and update current client patients that had a surgery, procedure or similar that resulted in the use of the coordinated care platform. It was a tool to maintain their health, and was also used to house their medical records and other important medical information. It was a jump-off for a lot of future iterations that never came to fruition.

			<p class="portfolioContent">
			Incredibly fun and creative project. "Decision Support" is simply an informative and user-driven education interview that explains employer benefit options, investment chocies and estimations and more than anything, helps you pick the right plans for you and your family based on your needs - which are culled from answering some simple questions about how you use medical, dental, etc. benefits.

			<p class="portfolioContent">
			Apple and Aetna teamed up to offer Apple Watches to employees enrolled in Aetna plans. Essentially an incentive program. In corralation with the company's wellness plan, the user / employee could earn money by completing wellness tasks that are trackable with the Apple Watch. By reaching those goals, they are rewarded. The users are given a free watch, but what actually happens is that the wellness incentives are paying for the watch's monthly payment plan.

The number of brokers have grown so much, that we've made a special version of the admin just for them. They use a piece here and a piece there of the offerings, and also need extensive comparison tools.
