<P class=synopsisdefault>For patients with chronic CHF, certain clinical factors have been found to predict all-cause mortality as well as cardiovascular death and <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure hospitalization. Age greater than 60 years old, diabetes, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (less than 45%) were the most powerful predictors. Other independent predictors that increased risk included higher NYHA class, cardiomegaly, prior CHF hospitalization, male sex, lower BMI, and lower DBP. Patients with these risk factors need particular care to ensure that short- and long-term outcomes are optimal. (Pocock SJ, Wang D, Pfeffer MA, et al. Predictors of mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure. Eur <SPAN class=hlght>Heart</SPAN> J. 2006; 27: 65-75). </P>

<P class=synopsisdefault>Multiple studies have shown that NT-proBNP levels correlate with adverse outcomes such as death, hospitalizations and cardiovascular events in <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure patients. One such study was designed to investigate whether a prognostic threshold level of NT-proBNP could be identified. 5875 primary care patients with suspected HF (median age 73 years) had NT-proBNP analysed. The overall effects of NT-proBNP were highly significant (P &lt; 0.001). An NT-proBNP level of 229-363 pg/mL was associated with a factor 1.8 increase in risk of death and an NT-proBNP level of only 83-118 pg/mL was associated with a factor 1.9 increase in risk of CV hospitalization. In Cox proportional hazards regression models regarding NT-proBNP levels, the seventh decile (range: 229-363 pg/mL) was associated with an 80% increased mortality risk and the fourth decile (range: 83-118 pg/mL) was associated with a 90% increased risk for CV hospitalization after adjustment for age, sex, previous hospitalization, CV diseases, and chronic diseases.PATIENT NT pro-BNP level far exceeded the cut-off levels shown to increase risk of all-cause mortality and CV hospitalizations.

<P class=synopsisdefault>The available evidence regarding treatment of <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure derives from randomized clinical trials from which COPD patients have been frequently excluded.

<P class=synopsisdefault>PATIENT chronically elevated Troponin levels were also predictive of adverse outcomes. Elevated concentrations of cardiac Troponins are detectable in patients with <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure in the absence of unstable coronary syndromes. Many studies have indicated that elevated Troponin concentrations in patients with <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure are associated with more severe disease and a worse prognosis. In a study of more than 4000 <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure patients, Latini et al found that baseline Troponin concentrations predicted mortality and <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure hospitalization above and beyond clinical predictors. Indeed, Troponin level was the most significant predictor of all-cause mortality, even when compared to clinical and echocardiographic variables.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Community-dwelling elderly persons, especially those with impaired left ventricular function, have a substantial risk for death from congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure. The risk for all-cause mortality was also greater in participants with no congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure who had impaired or borderline left ventricular function. The adjusted risk for cardiovascular mortality was increased in persons with borderline or impaired left ventricular function but no congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure and in persons with congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure and impaired left ventricular function. Previous reports from the Cardiovascular Health Study have demonstrated that most community-based elderly persons with congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure have normal left ventricular systolic function; that normal systolic function most commonly precedes incident congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure; and that the predictors of congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure in elderly persons with or without systolic dysfunction include clinical and subclinical coronary <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> disease, systolic blood pressure, inflammation, left atrial size, and diastolic dysfunction. Participants with borderline left ventricular function with or without <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure remained at risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction after adjustment for covariates, whereas participants in the other groups did not. Our principal finding is that community-based elderly persons with congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure have a substantial risk for death, even in the presence of normal or borderline decreased left ventricular systolic function.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Patients with diabetes had a significantly increased adjusted relative risk (RR) for total mortality, death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), new MI, stroke, and new congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure. It is now well established that a number of traditional CHD risk factors (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, insulin resistance) tend to occur together in patients with diabetes. Approximately 50% of patients with diabetes have hypertension, and more than 30% have hypercholesterolemia at the time of diagnosis. As in nondiabetic patients, these risk factors independently predict the risk of CVD mortality. However, even in the presence of one or more concomitant risk factors, diabetes increases the CVD death rate. It also appears that diabetes interacts synergistically with other risk factors to more sharply increase risk as the number of total risk factors increases.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Mitral regurgitation (MR) and tricuspid regurgitation (TR) frequently develop in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Ventricular volume overload that occurs in patients with MR and TR may lead to progression of myocardial dysfunction. We hypothesized that MR and TR would provide markers of risk in patients with LVSD. Patients with severe MR or TR represent high-risk subsets of patients with LVSD.Patients with congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure (CHF) and left ventricular dilation often have mitral regurgitation (MR). The mechanism of MR includes apical and posterior displacement of the papillary muscles, which results in abnormal coaptation of the mitral leaflets. Annular dilation also may contribute to creation of MR. This condition is termed secondary or functional MR and has a high prevalence in patients with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Chronic MR leads, through mechanical and neurohormonal mechanisms, to further depression of left ventricular contractility and may hasten the deaths of patients through a progressive spiral of left ventricular dilation leading to MR leading to further left ventricular dilation. Previous investigators have shown that the presence of MR in patients with LVSD is associated with poor prognosis. Right ventricular dysfunction and the presence of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) also have been shown to predict mortality in these patients.We conclude that MR and TR are common in LVSD and that the severity of these measures correlate with a worse clinical outcome. The ability of MR severity to predict an adverse outcome exceeds that of several more traditional parameters, such as LVEF.(Koelling TM, Aaronson KD, Cody RJ, et al. Prognostic Significance of Mitral Regurgitation and Tricuspid Regurgitation in Patients With Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Patients with aortic stenosis ultimately experience the classic triad of chest pain, <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure, and syncope. Chest pain in patients with aortic stenosis is typically precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest and it may resemble angina from coronary artery disease. <SPAN class=hlght>Heart</SPAN> failure symptoms (ie, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, and shortness of breath) may be due to systolic dysfunction from afterload mismatch, ischemia, or a separate cardiomyopathic process. Alternatively, diastolic dysfunction from LV hypertrophy or ischemia may also result in <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure symptoms. Syncope from aortic stenosis is often due to a fixed forward stroke volume causes the arterial systolic blood pressure to decline. It also may be caused by atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Syncope at rest may be due to transient ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or (if calcification of the valve extends into the conduction system) atrioventricular block. (Ren X.

<P class=synopsisdefault>A medical study of elderly patients reflected that sinus bradycardia can facilitate the appearance of overt <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure in patients over 80 years of age with organic <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> disease and severe chronotropic incompetence even without left ventricular dysfunction. Consequently volume changes are not well tolerated in the elderly and a slow <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> rate is responsible for a marked increase in diastolic ventricular volumes. Therefore, sinus bradycardia could facilitate the development of <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure through an inadequate cardiac output or by increasing ventricular volumes which may markedly increase left ventricular diastolic pressures to such an extent, pulmonary congestion develops even if systolic function is normal. It was recommended by this study that this group should be periodically checked for the possibility of overt congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure despite previous normal left ventricular function.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and is an important independent risk factor for stroke. AF is present in 2 million people in the United States. Its prevalence begins to increase in both genders after age 40 years and rises rapidly after age 65 years. AF is particularly common in the elderly, reaching a prevalence of roughly 10% in those 80 years old. The median age of patients with AF is approximately 75 years. The rate of ischemic stroke among patients with AF included in clinical trials of primary prevention and not treated with antithrombotic therapy averages about 5%/yr, with wide, clinically important variation among subpopulations of AF patients. AF becomes an increasingly important cause of stroke with advancing age. In the Framingham <SPAN class=hlght>Heart</SPAN> Study, the attributable risk of stroke in AF patients rose from 1.5% in the 50- to 59-year age group to 23.5% in the 80- to 89-year age group. In patients 80 years old, AF was the only cardiovascular condition associated with an increased risk of stroke. A subsequent AFI analysis of echocardiograms done in three of the original trials found that moderate-to-severe LV dysfunction was an additional strong risk factor (Risk Reduction – RR). A recurrent clinical concern is whether patients with paroxysmal, or intermittent, AF (PAF) face the same risk of stroke as those with sustained AF. Periods of sinus rhythm should lessen stroke risk, yet transitions from AF to sinus rhythm may acutely heighten risk in a manner similar to the increase in risk caused by cardioversion . However, when associated stroke risk factors are controlled for, clinical trial data suggest that PAF confers an RR of stroke similar to constant AF. Finally, studies have shown that AF patients with prosthetic <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> valves (both mechanical and tissue valves) or rheumatic mitral valve disease are at high risk of stroke.

<P class=synopsisdefault>In the absence of underlying <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> disease, syncope is not associated with excess mortality. The main risk is related to physical harm that may occur if the patient has recurrent syncope. In this setting, the intensity of the workup to establish a diagnosis is determined by the “malignancy” of the episode. For the purposes of this statement, a malignant episode of syncope is defined as an episode of syncope that occurs with little or no warning and results in a significant injury or property damage, eg, a car accident.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Lower Hb is associated with greater disease severity, a greater left ventricular mass index, and higher hospitalization and mortality rates. The hemodynamic changes accompanying severe anemia include increased preload, reduced peripheral resistance, and increased cardiac output. Vasodilatation may be due to reduced blood viscosity that is mediated in part by enhanced nitric oxide production. These adaptive responses may ultimately lead to an increase in LV mass, a significant factor for poor prognosis for cardiovascular and overall outcomes. Even relatively small decreases around a normal Hb value may have deleterious effects on myocardial remodeling and contribute to worsening CHF. Treatment possibilities include the use of erythropoietic stimulating proteins, blood transfusion, or alteration in medications that may contribute to the development of anemia, along with the development of fluid overload and hemodilution.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Several cardiovascular risk factors increase the risk of coronary <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> disease (CHD). Two of the most prevalent and asymptomatic risk factors for CHD are hypertension and dyslipidemia and they commonly co-exist. The CHD risk in patients with co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia is greater than the sum of CHD risks for hypertension and dyslipidemia when they occur alone. The most common additional risk factors were age (81.7% of men were 45 years or older and 59.4% of women were 55 years and older) and diabetes (43.9%).

<P class=synopsisdefault>Chest pain is one of the most common causes of presentation to the emergency room. The diagnosis of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome typically causes uncertainty. Classical considerations for risk stratification are History, ECG, Age, Risk factors and Troponin (<SPAN class=hlght>HEART</SPAN>). Each can be scored with zero, one or two points, depending on the extent of the abnormality. The <SPAN class=hlght>HEART</SPAN> score is the sum of these five considerations. Methods. Clinical data from 122 patients referred to the emergency room for chest pain were analysed. The predictive value of the <SPAN class=hlght>HEART</SPAN> score for reaching an endpoint was evaluated in 120/122 patients. Twenty-nine patients reached one or more endpoints: an acute myocardial infarction was diagnosed in 16 patients, 20 underwent revascularisation and two died. The <SPAN class=hlght>HEART</SPAN> score in the patients with and without an endpoint was 6.51±1.84 and 3.71±1.83 (p&lt;0.0001) respectively. A <SPAN class=hlght>HEART</SPAN> score of 0-3 points holds a risk of 2.5% for an endpoint and supports an immediate discharge. With a risk of 20.3%, a <SPAN class=hlght>HEART</SPAN> score of 4-6 points implies admission for clinical observation. A <SPAN class=hlght>HEART</SPAN> score =7points, with a risk of 72.7%, supports early invasive strategies.

<P class=synopsisdefault>LVDD is much more common than previously reported in subjects with well-controlled type 2 diabetes who are free of clinically detectable <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> disease. Epidemiological data indicate a greater risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure, in diabetic subjects compared with nondiabetic subjects (1). Clinical, epidemiological, and pathological studies attribute the increased occurrence of clinical congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure in diabetic subjects to diabetic cardiomyopathy, which could take the form of diastolic and/or systolic left ventricular dysfunction (2,3). Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) may represent the first stage of diabetic cardiomyopathy (3), reinforcing the importance of early examination of diastolic ventricular function in individuals with diabetes. Therefore, the high prevalence of LVDD suggested by this study supports the use of echocardiography in the initial clinical evaluation of subjects with type 2 diabetes.

<P class=synopsisdefault>The Framingham Study showed a twofold to threefold elevation in the risk of clinically evident atherosclerotic disease in patients with T2DM compared to those without diabetes. Diabetic men in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) had an absolute risk of CHD death more than three times higher than that in the nondiabetic cohort, even after adjustment for established risk factors. Seminal work from Finland showed that patients with T2DM without a previous myocardial infarction have a risk of myocardial infarction (MI) over 7 years as high as nondiabetic patients with an MI. In this study, the case fatality rate following an MI was also substantially higher in patients with diabetes. In women, diabetes mitigates the cardioprotective effects of the premenopausal period, and women with diabetes had a CHD mortality rate as high as that in diabetic men.(Kronenberg : Williams Textbook of Endocrinology, 11th Edition.

<P class=synopsisdefault><SPAN class=hlght>Heart</SPAN> failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been extensively studied separately, but there is a scarcity of reports specifically addressing the combination. According to available evidence, COPD and <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure often coexist. The prevalence of <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure in COPD patients varies between 7.2 and 20.9%. The prevalence of COPD in patients with <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure ranges from approximately 10.0 to 39.0% and is up to 35% in patients admitted with <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure.&nbsp; In order to explain the high rate of coexistence of these two a etiologically distinct conditions, several plausible theories have been proposed, namely, the sharing of smoking as a major risk factor and the association of low-grade systemic inflammation present in COPD patients with the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Regardless of the potential mechanisms underlying the combination, current estimates of COPD and <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure concurrence are worrisome.(Mascarenhas J, Azavedo A, and Bettencourt P.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Impaired LV early diastolic relaxation, detected by pulsed Doppler echocardiography, identifies hypertensive patients at increased cardiovascular risk. Such association is independent of LV mass and ambulatory BP. Abnormalities of left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling have often been described in patients with hypertension , even in the absence of LV hypertrophy. Doppler imaging of the mitral inflow has gained wide acceptance for the evaluation of hypertensive patients, as a simple, noninvasive and easily repeatable method of assessing LV diastolic filling. Diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive patients is characterized primarily by impaired isovolumic relaxation. As a consequence, the velocity of early diastolic filling decreases and the late atrioventricular gradient increases, yielding a decreased early/atrial (E/A) velocity ratio.Although they are only approximate and indirect measures of LV diastolic function, flow velocity-derived indexes of diastolic filling are widely recommended for the diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction, and they provide independent prognostic information in different clinical settings and populations, including congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure, the early phases of myocardial infarction and the elderly.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Despite remarkable improvements in medical therapy, the prognosis of patients with myocardial failure remains poor, with almost 20% of patients dying within 1 year of initial diagnosis and &gt;80% 8-year mortality. Of the deaths in patients with HF, up to 50% are sudden and unexpected; indeed, patients with HF have 6- to 9-times the rate of sudden cardiac death (SCD) of the general population. Patients with <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure experience a number of changes in the electrical function of the <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> that predispose to potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias. Action potential prolongation, the result of functional down regulation of K currents, and aberrant Ca2+ handling is a recurrent theme. Significant alterations in conduction and activation of a number of initially adaptive but ultimately maladaptive signaling cascades contribute to the generation of a highly arrhythmogenic substrate. The presumption is that SCD is produced by a lethal cardiac arrhythmia, most often ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Bradyarrhythmias and pulseless electrical activity occur less frequently, and generally in <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN>s with more advanced structural disease. Some data suggest that bradyarrhythmias and pulseless electrical activity may account for an increasing percentage of SCDs, because the frequency of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation (VT/VF) may be decreasing.

Although viral, autoimmune and idiopathic factors may be contributory, its etiology remains unknown. PPCM initially presents with signs and symptoms of congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure and rarely with thrombo-embolic complications. The occurrence of thromboembolism in PPCM may be due to the hypercoagulable state of pregnancy and the left ventricular dysfunction which causes a relative blood stasis. This warrants the initiation of anticoagulation therapy in the presence of severe left ventricular dysfunction. Upper abdominal discomfort occurs in approximately half of the patients diagnosed with PPCM as a result of an enlarged congested liver. The current consensus in the management of PPCM is to initiate anticoagulation therapy in the presence of severe left ventricular function (LVEF = 35%). However, abdominal pain in the absence of congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure symptoms, may indicate the presence of thromboemboli of the abdominal organs. This may be a further indication for anticoagulation. Early diagnosis and treatment of PPCM are essential for a favorable outcome and poor prognostic factors include high parity, twin gestation, age greater than 30 years, and a late onset of symptoms after delivery. In patients with PPCM the return of the left ventricle size and function to normal in the first 5 months of the postpartum period is a good prognostic factor. This usually occurs in 50% of patients with PPCM. Patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) may rarely be predisposed to thromboembolic phenomenon due to blood stasis resulting from the hypercoagulable state of pregnancy and the depressed left ventricular systolic function typical of this disease.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Almost 35 million Americans—20% of all people in the middle-adult years and 35% of the entire older population—have some degree of abnormal glucose tolerance; this higher-risk group will account for a significant portion of CVD and premature mortality in the United States. The prevalence of, incidence of, and mortality from all forms of CVD are 2- to 8-fold higher in persons with diabetes than in those without diabetes. The proportion of new-onset CVD attributable to diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance ranges from 14% in whites to 50% to 80% in American Indians. Diabetes, notably type 2 diabetes, is on the rise in children and adolescents, thereby increasing the likelihood that they will develop premature coronary <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> disease (CHD). Elevated blood pressure is a major independent risk factor for CHD, stroke, chronic renal failure, and <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure. The prevalence of hypertension is increased in patients with diabetes. In-hospital and long-term mortality rates after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are twice as high among individuals with diabetes as among those without diabetes. Factors specific to diabetes may not only increase the risk of MI but also adversely affect its outcome. Sympathovagal imbalance lowers the threshold for life-threatening arrhythmia and increases the risk of hemodynamic instability. Elevated fibrinogen levels, elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels, and platelet abnormalities may increase the risk of thrombosis at the site of plaque disruption and possibly increase the risk of reinfarction after thrombolytic therapy. The diabetic ventricle is more prone to maladaptive remodeling that increases the risk of <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure and cardiogenic shock. (Grundy SM, Howard B, Smith JR, S, et al.

These characteristics together with the usual hemodynamic pulsating expansion during systole and elastic recoil contraction during diastole contribute to a high mechanical stress zone on the fibrous cap of the atheroma, making it prone to rupture. Increased hemodynamic stress correlates with increased rates of major cardiovascular events associated with exercise, especially exercise beyond levels the individual does routinely.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Because there is little if any effective contraction of the atria there is stasis (pooling) of blood in the atria. Stasis of blood in susceptible individuals can lead to formation of thrombus (blood clots) within the <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN>. Thrombus is most likely to form in the atrial appendages. Clot in the left atrial appendage is particularly important since the left side of the <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> supplies blood to the entire body. Thus, any thrombus material that dislodges from this side of the <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> can embolize to the brain, with the potentially devastating consequence of a stroke. Thrombus material can of course embolize to any other portion of the body, though usually with a less severe outcome. (Rosenthal L. Atrial Flutter: Overview.

<P class=synopsisdefault>By definition, the cause of death in SUDEP is currently unknown. A number of postmortem, ictal and interictal cardiac abnormalities do, however, suggest the possibility of seizure-induced cardiogenic SUDEP. Postmortem examinations in people dying of SUDEP have found <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN>s that are dilated and heavier than expected and pulmonary edema in approximately 50–86% of cases. Furthermore, others have described pathological changes in the <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN>s of those dying with SUDEP, including fibrosis of the walls of small coronary arteries, atrophy of cardiomyocytes, myofibrillar degeneration, edema of the conductive tissue and morphological abnormalities of the cardiac conduction system. These abnormalities may be the consequence of repeated hypoxemia and/or may be associated with the increase of catecholamines during an ictal sympathetic storm. Several studies have assessed the frequency and character of ictal cardiac rhythm during seizures and the most compelling evidence derives from the presence of ictal arrhythmias. When ictal cardiorespiratory variables were recorded in people with epilepsy, an increase in <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> rate in 91% of 41 seizures and a transient bradycardia in five seizures (four patients) were found. Another study evaluated the eletrocardiographic (ECG) changes during 51 seizures in 43 patients with refractory epilepsy. This showed that 70% of patients had either ECG abnormalities (16%), tachycardias (30%), or both (23%) during the ictal and/or post-ictal period. These changes may all be relevant to the pathophysiology of SUDEP. (Scorza FA, Colugnati DB, Pansani AP, et al.

The physical impairments due to syncope are comparable with chronic illnesses such as chronic arthritis, recurrent moderate depressive disorders, and end-stage renal disease. In patients with frequent recurrent syncope, psychosocial impairments had an estimated average adverse impact on 33% of the assessed aspects of daily life. Syncope reduces mobility, usual abilities and self-caring, and increased depression, pain and discomfort. Female gender, high level of co-morbidity, number of episodes of syncope, and presence of pre-syncope seemed to be associated with poorer quality of life. Finally, it should be stressed that, while syncope occurs intermittently, its threat of recurrence continuously impairs quality of life.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Other than alcohol, cocaine is the most common cause of acute drug-related emergency department (ED) visits in the United States (US). Cocaine's vasoconstrictive properties prolong the rate of absorption and delay its peak effect when absorbed from mucosal surfaces. The bioavailability of cocaine is approximately 90 percent when smoked. Cocaine produces a dose-dependent increase in <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> rate and blood pressure; it produces end-organ toxicity in virtually every organ system in the body, primarily through its hemodynamic effects. It causes coronary vasoconstriction in a dose-dependent fashion and is associated with cardiac ischemia, may cause acute depression of left ventricular function and <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure, and can cause supraventricular and ventricular dysrhythmias. CNS complications may include psychomotor agitation, seizures, coma, headache, intracranial hemorrhage, and focal neurologic symptoms. Intranasal and inhalational cocaine use is associated with pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and pneumopericardium. These complications result from the Valsalva maneuver applied by the user to avoid exhaling the drug. Patients with cocaine toxicity can present with a spectrum of musculoskeletal concerns. Signs can range from mild creatinine phosphokinase and myoglobin elevation to electrolyte alterations (hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia) seen with rhabdomyolysis. It is also implicated in cases of ischemic colitis, intestinal infarction, and metabolic acidosis. (Nelson L. Cocaine: Acute Intoxication.

<P class=synopsisdefault>According to the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General, in a summary entitled Medicare Hospital Discharge Planning : The hospital discharge planning is a process where a plan is developed for a patient to receive appropriate post-hospital placement and services. Effective discharge planning identifies the patient’s post-hospital needs early to ensure discharge to a safe environment with the appropriate level of services. Typical high risk criteria might include: age 65 and older, living alone with no immediate social supports; stroke, <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> attack, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure, emphysema, dementia, Alzheimers, AIDS, or other possibly life threatening illnesses; admission from a residential care home; homelessness; and no insurance. Federal regulations require that hospitals have in place a discharge planning process. This process must apply not only to Medicare and Medicaid patients but to all patients served by the hospital who need discharge planning. The rules include requirements that a discharge planning evaluation be completed for patients identified during the initial screening, including an evaluation of the patient’s capacity for self-care and the possibility of this patient being cared for in the environment from which he/she entered the hospital.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Unrecognized or ‘‘silent’’ myocardial infarction (MI) is common, and may account for 20–60% of all MI in otherwise asymptomatic patients over the age of 45. The diagnosis of unrecognized infarction has traditionally been defined as the presence of pathologic Q waves on the electrocardiogram (ECG) of a patient without a clinical history of MI. The prognostic significance of Q waves, indicative of unrecognized infarction, is similar to clinically recognized infarction in the general population. Only one major study in asymptomatic subjects has suggested that unrecognized infarction may be more benign than recognized infarction. Unrecognized infarcts are also at least as likely as recognized infarcts to lead to <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure and stroke. Studies have further shown that Q waves carry an increased risk for impaired functional status and all-cause mortality, effects which both appear to be mediated by structural abnormalities suggestive of global rather than regional cardiac dysfunction.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Preclinical diastolic dysfunction (PDD) has been defined as subjects with normal systolic function, diastolic dysfunction but no symptoms of <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure (HF). The authors used resources of the Mayo Clinic echocardiography database to consecutively select among patients who had an echocardiogram in 2005, a cohort with moderate or severe diastolic dysfunction by Doppler criteria and EF &gt;or=50%. The mean age of the cohort of PDD subjects was 69+/-10 years with a female (67%) preponderance. Presence of hypertension was 76%, coronary artery disease was 29%, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was 26%, estimated creatinine clearance &lt;60 ml/min was 51%. The 2-year cumulative probability of development of HF according to the Framingham criteria was 1.9%; however, the 2-year cumulative probability of development of any symptoms was 31.1%. The 2-year cumulative probability for cardiac hospitalisation was 21.2%. Peripheral vascular disease and hypertension were independently associated with increased likelihood for the development of symptoms.CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, CAD and renal dysfunction are prevalent in patients with PDD.

<P class=synopsisdefault>The guideline update for PCI published by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) / American <SPAN class=hlght>Heart</SPAN> Association (AHA) revealed that these procedures are associated with increased risk of adverse outcome and mortality depending on the patient’s comorbidities. Complications of PCI have been categorized as major (death, MI, and stroke) or minor (transient ischemic attack, access site complications, renal insufficiency, or adverse reactions to radiographic contrast). Additional specific complications include intracoronary thrombosis, coronary perforation, tamponade, and arrhythmias. Analyses of large registries indicated overall unadjusted in-hospital rates of mortality for PCI of 0.4% to 1.9%. This range is greatly influenced by the clinical indication for which PCI is performed with the highest mortality rates occurring among patients with STEMI and cardiogenic shock. Death in such patients may not be a direct result of the PCI procedure but rather a consequence of the patient’s underlying illness. (Smith SC Jr, Feldman TE, Hirshfeld JW Jr, et al.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Risk assessment is critical in the treatment and cost-effective disposition of a patient with GI bleeding; therefore, focus on elements of the history that are most closely associated with a high likelihood of rebleeding and mortality. In a 2001 review of the available literature, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy identified four non-endoscopically derived “key predictors” of rebleeding that should be the focus of the initial evaluation because of their usefulness as risk stratifiers in multiple studies: 1) older age; 2) shock (hemodynamic instability or orthostasis); 3) comorbid disease states; and 4) the use of anticoagulants or the presence of coagulopathy. Important comorbid illnesses that are predictive of increased mortality include congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure, coronary artery disease, known liver disease, a history of alcoholism, a history of smoking, and diabetes mellitus. A review of medications should be made with particular attention to those agents known to increase the risk of GI bleeding.

For most of these indications, a moderate anticoagulant intensity (INR 2.0 to 3.0) is appropriate. Long-term anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) also is indicated in patients who have sustained one or more episodes of systemic thromboembolism. Reduced left ventricular systolic function is associated with both stroke and mortality even in the absence of documented atrial fibrillation. Long-term anticoagulant therapy also is indicated in patients with ischemic stroke of unknown origin who have a combination of a patent foramen ovale and atrial septal aneurysm because these patients have an increased the risk of recurrent stroke despite treatment with aspirin.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) largely as a result of the progressively increasing age of ESRD patients and the broad constellation of uremia-associated factors that can adversely affect cardiac function. Hypertension, one of the leading causes of renal failure, is a major culprit in this process, causing left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac chamber dilation, increased left ventricular wall stress, redistribution of coronary blood flow, reduced coronary artery vasodilator reserve, ischemia, myocardial fibrosis, <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure, and arrhythmias. In addition to impairing the coronary microcirculation, hypertension may contribute to the development of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, particularly in the presence of the many lipid abnormalities observed in ESRD. These patients have reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased plasma triglyceride concentrations, and there is a defect in cholesterol transport. Other abnormalities that may contribute to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease in ESRD are reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol synthesis and reduced activity of the reverse cholesterol pathway. Treatment with fibric acids, nicotinic acids, and lovastatin may be useful in lowering cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in some of these patients. The incidence of coronary artery disease in ESRD populations is difficult to determine. About 25 to 30% of ESRD patients with angina have no evidence of significant coronary artery disease, and an undetermined number have silent coronary disease. The presence of resting electrocardiographic abnormalities caused by hypertension or conduction defects makes it difficult to accurately diagnosis coronary artery disease in ESRD populations by noninvasive methods, including exercise testing and thallium scintigraphy with or without the use of dipyridamole.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Methylphenidate, an amphetamine-related drug, is widely used in paediatric patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). At therapeutic doses, it increases the <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> rate and blood pressure. Myocardial ischaemia and infarction are important cardiovascular manifestations in this situation. Because of the similar effects to cocaine and amphetamines, there are recent concerns on the abuse of methylphenidate in the United States especially in adolescents. Methylphenidate, similar to cocaine, can be abused orally, intra-nasally or even parenterally by injecting a solution from dissolving tablets in water. In a human voluntary study, methylphenidate increased dopamine and epinephrine in the striatum of the brain and plasma respectively which are responsible for its pressor effects. The increase in adrenergic action in overdose situation can result in sympathomimetic syndrome. Patients may present with central nervous and cardiovascular symptoms including irritability, agitation, euphoria, psychosis, seizure, tachycardia, symptoms of myocardial ischaemia or even infarction. In case of severe intoxication, there may be hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis. Myocardial ischaemia was reported in a 16-year-old male after an increased dose of methylphenidate to 100 mg/day for 3 doses. There was ischemic change over the anterior chest leads of the ECG and elevated cardiac enzyme. There were also case reports of acute myocardial infarction in young patients who took therapeutic doses of methylphenidate with concomitant use of other medications (bupropion, erythromycin and peudoephedrine).

<P class=synopsisdefault>“Adverse events that occur during an infusion are called infusion reactions. These have been observed in approximately 3-7% of patients who have received multiple infusions. Patients experiencing an infusion reaction may have flushing, <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN>burn, chest tightness, and or fever. Some patients have developed hives. In general, these reactions are mild and on discontinuation of the infusion, symptoms typically resolved within minutes. The majority of patients are able to tolerate re-administration of their infusion at a slower rate once their symptoms are resolved. It remains unclear whether these types of adverse events that occur during infusion are specifically related to the anti-TNF-a antibody or to other aspects of the infusion process. However, antibodies to Remicade (HACA) have been detected in the bloodstream of some patients (13%) who have previously received the drug. These antibodies may predispose patients to infusion reactions, which have been found to be more common (33%) in patients who have received multiple infusions or have detectable HACA in the bloodstream. Other immunologic side effects that are of concern include the development of a delayed hypersensitivity (DH) reaction. DH was reported to occur in 25% of patients after receiving a repeat infusion of Remicade after a 2-4 year interval since a prior infusion. Arthralgia, fever, rash, and pruritus characterized the delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Although HACA was not elevated prior to the delayed hypersensitivity reaction, HACA was significantly increased after the DH reaction. In general, delayed hypersensitivity was associated with a very long time interval between infusions; however, DH reaction has been described as occurring after an interval as short as 5 months. The most common complication reported during treatment with Remicade has been infection. TNF-a plays an integral role in the host's defense against infectious organisms, and inhibiting the bioactivity of TNF-a may seriously impair a patient's ability to fight infection. This underscores the need for patients to be evaluated for ongoing infectious processes that are preexisting or that develop during anti-TNF-a treatment. Bowel obstruction is another potential complication related to anti-TNF-a use. Fibrosis and scarring that accompanies rapid healing may worsen areas of existing intestinal stricture.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Left ventricular (LV) pseudoaneurysms form when cardiac rupture is contained by adherent pericardium or scar tissue. Although LV pseudoaneurysms are not common, the diagnosis is difficult and they are prone to rupture. One study evaluated the clinical presentation, diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities, results of therapy and prognosis of 290 patients with LV pseudoaneurysms. Most cases of LV pseudoaneurysm were related to myocardial infarction (particularly inferior wall myocardial infarction) and cardiac surgery. Congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure, chest pain and dyspnea were the most frequently reported symptoms, but &gt;10% of patients were asymptomatic. Physical examination revealed a murmur in 70% of patients. Almost all patients had electrocardiographic abnormalities, but these were usually nonspecific ST segment changes; only 20% of patients had ST segment elevation. Although radiographic findings were also usually nonspecific, the appearance of a mass was present in more than one half of patients and may be an important clue to the correct diagnosis. Left ventricular angiography was the most definitive test and can be useful in planning surgery since concomitant coronary angiography can be performed. Regardless of treatment, patients with LV pseudoaneurysms had a high mortality rate, especially those who did not undergo surgery. Because the symptoms, signs, electrocardiographic abnormalities and radiographic findings seen in patients with LV pseudoaneurysms can be indistinguishable from those in patients with coronary disease alone, a high clinical index of suspicion is needed to avoid missing the diagnosis.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis. Even modest reductions in expiratory flow volumes elevate the risk of ischemic <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> diseases, strokes, and sudden cardiac deaths 2- to 3-fold, independent of other risk factors. Indeed, poor lung function has been shown to be a better predictor of all-cause and cardiac-specific mortality than established risk factors such as serum cholesterol. Cardiovascular conditions are the leading cause of mortality among those with impaired lung function. We analyzed data from participants, 50 years of age, of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n=6629) to determine whether C-reactive protein (CRP) and other systemic inflammatory markers are present in participants with chronic airflow obstruction and are associated with cardiac injury. Participants with severe airflow obstruction had circulating leukocyte, platelet, and fibrinogen levels that were 460/µL (95% confidence interval [CI], 30 to 890/µL), 39 510/µL (95% CI, 21 730 to 57 290/µL), and 41.63 mg/dL (95% CI, 19.87 to 63.39 mg/dL) higher, respectively, than in those without airflow obstruction. They were also 2.18 times (95% CI, 1.46 to 3.27) more likely to have an elevated circulating CRP level. Moderate airflow obstruction was associated with smaller but still significant increases in these levels. Moderate and severe airflow obstruction was associated with increased occurrence of ischemic changes on electrocardiograms of participants. In the presence of both highly elevated CRP and moderate or severe airflow obstruction, the Cardiac Infarction Injury Score was 2.68 and 5.88 U higher, respectively, than in those without airflow obstruction and with low CRP, which suggests an additive effect of CRP and COPD on the risk of cardiac injury. Low-grade systemic inflammation was present in participants with moderate to severe airflow obstruction and was associated with increased risk of cardiac injury. This may in part explain the high rates of cardiovascular complications in COPD. (Sin DD and Man P.

<P class=synopsisdefault>The cardiac manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are numerous. Impairments of right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary vascular disease are well known to complicate the clinical course of COPD and correlate inversely with survival. The pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular disease in COPD is likely multifactorial and related to alterations in gas exchange and vascular biology, as well as structural changes of the pulmonary vasculature and mechanical factors. Several modalities currently exist for the assessment of pulmonary vascular disease in COPD, but right <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> catheterization remains the gold standard. Although no specific therapy other than oxygen has been generally accepted for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in this population, there has been renewed interest in specific pulmonary vasodilators. The coexistence of COPD and coronary artery disease occurs frequently. This association is likely related to shared risk factors as well as similar pathogenic mechanisms, such as systemic inflammation. Management strategies for the care of patients with COPD and coronary artery disease are similar to those without COPD, but care must be given to address their respiratory limitations.

In general, patients who develop HCAP are more similar to hospitalized patients than to true community patients, in that they have a greater burden of comorbidities, including cancer, chronic kidney disease, <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, immunosuppression, dementia, and impaired mobility. An important distinction of HCAP is that the pathogens are often multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. Therefore, the initial treatment of HCAP should be similar to that of HAP and VAP, which also differentiates it from CAP. This is particularly important for clinicians working in first-response areas, such as emergency departments (EDs), to recognize, so that appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy is not delayed. Several studies have demonstrated that delaying the delivery of pathogen-appropriate antimicrobial therapy to patients with CAP and VAP results in excess mortality. Thus, it is essential for physicians working in the ED to distinguish between HCAP and CAP, in order to correctly assess and manage suspected cases of pneumonia.

<P class=synopsisdefault>In end-stage renal disease (ESRD) both an inappropriately high sympathetic drive and the activation of tissue-based renin-angiotensin systems lead to a complex pattern of comorbidity appearing early on in renal disease. In this context, uremic cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and renal failure display an intimate interaction that critically defines the prognosis in dialysis patients. Importantly, patients with moderate to severe loss of renal function not only carry a high burden of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, but also are exposed to uremia-specific risk factors that in concert induce an excessively increased cardiovascular mortality. Although cardiovascular guidelines may not simply be applicable to ESRD patients--these have invariably been excluded from larger cardiovascular trials--an early cardiological workup appears rational as the prevailing mode of death is characterized by sudden cardiac death and <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) is among the least recognized and understood complications of diabetes despite its significant negative impact on survival and quality of life in people with diabetes. Despite its relationship to an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and its association with multiple symptoms and impairments, the significance of DAN has not been fully appreciated. The reported prevalence of DAN varies widely depending on the cohort studied and the methods of assessment. DAN frequently coexists with other peripheral neuropathies and other diabetic complications, but DAN may be isolated, frequently preceding the detection of other complications. Major clinical manifestations of DAN include resting tachycardia, exercise intolerance, orthostatic hypotension, constipation, gastroparesis, erectile dysfunction, sudomotor dysfunction, impaired neurovascular function, “brittle diabetes,” and hypoglycemic autonomic failure. DAN may affect many organ systems throughout the body (e.g., gastrointestinal [GI], genitourinary, and cardiovascular). GI disturbances (e.g., esophageal enteropathy, gastroparesis, constipation, diarrhea, and fecal incontinence) are common, and any section of the GI tract may be affected. Gastroparesis should be suspected in individuals with erratic glucose control. Neurovascular dysfunction resulting from DAN contributes to a wide spectrum of clinical disorders including erectile dysfunction, loss of skin integrity, and abnormal vascular reflexes. Meta-analyses of published data demonstrate that reduced cardiovascular autonomic function as measured by <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> rate variability (HRV) is strongly (i.e., relative risk is doubled) associated with an increased risk of silent myocardial ischemia and mortality. Subclinical autonomic dysfunction can, however, occur within a year of diagnosis in type 2 diabetes patients and within two years in type 1diabetes patients. Because of its association with a variety of adverse outcomes including cardiovascular deaths, cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is the most clinically important and well-studied form of DAN.

The prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidity is difficult to assess accurately, because cardiovascular disease (CVD) has a tendency to remain silent in the rheumatoid patient. It is not clear why rheumatoid patients have higher rates of coronary disease. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors do not seem to be wholly responsible for the increased cardiovascular risk.

<P class=synopsisdefault>A recent study developed a risk score to predict in-hospital mortality for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using a statewide population-based PCI registry. In this study, a risk score system for predicting the risk of in-hospital mortality for PCI was developed based on the data of 46,090 procedures performed New York in 2002. The system was then validated using data collected from 50,046 procedures in 2003. A patient’s total risk score was calculated by adding up the points for all existing risk factors. The minimum total risk score was 0 for a patient without any risk factors listed in Table 2, and the maximum possible score is 40. The predicted probabilities of in-hospital death for each risk score ranged from 0.05% for a score of 0, 1.2% for score of 10, 21.25% for a score of 20, 86.59% for a score of 30 and 99.63% for a score of 40 (Table 3). Complications collected in the data system include stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), acute occlusion in the targeted lesion or in a significant side branch, vessel injury at the catheter entry site requiring intervention, renal failure, emergency cardiac surgery, stent thrombosis, and emergency PCI. The PCI risk score also includes congestive <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> failure and left main disease. This risk score should be used as a tool to help physicians and patients to make informed decisions of the predictions of in-hospital mortality for PCI. (Wu C, Hannan EL, Walford G, et al.

Additional specific complications include intracoronary thrombosis, coronary perforation, tamponade, and arrythmias.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Due to abrupt coronary occlusion or intracoronary embolization of obstructive debris, myocardial infarction (MI) can be a direct result of PCI. The conventional definition requires 2 of the following; a) prolonged chest discomfort or its equivalent; b) development of pathologic Q waves; and c) rise in serum cardiac biomarkers above a critical level. The rates of periprocedural MI using this definition have ranged from 0.4% to 4.9%. The current ACC/AHA/SCAI Writing Committee recommends that all patients who have signs or symptoms suggestive of MI during or after PCI and those with complicated procedures should have CK-MB and troponin I or T measured after the procedure. In addition, the Committee recommends that routine measurement of cardiac biomarkers (CK-MB and/or troponin I or T) in every patient undergoing PCI is reasonable 8 to 12 hours after the procedure. In such patients, a new CK-MB or troponin I or T rise greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal would constitute a clinically significant periprocedural MI.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Acute occlusion involving the unprotected left main coronary artery (ULMCA) is a clinically catastrophic event, often leading to abrupt and severe circulatory failure, lethal arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Although coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the standard of care for ULMCA disease in patients with stable ischemic <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> disease, uncertainty surrounds the optimal revascularization strategy for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) and ULMCA occlusion who survive to hospitalization, and treatment guidelines in this setting are vague. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is technically feasible in most patients, has the advantage of providing more rapid reperfusion compared with CABG with acceptable short- and long-term outcomes, and is associated with a lower risk of stroke. PCI of the ULMCA should be considered as a viable alternative to CABG for selected patients with MI, including those with ULMCA occlusion and less than Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3, cardiogenic shock, persistent ventricular arrhythmias, and significant comorbidities. The higher risk of target vessel revascularization associated with ULMCA PCI compared with CABG is an acceptable tradeoff given the primary need for rapid reperfusion to enhance survival.

<P class=synopsisdefault>In a large, population based sample of pregnant women admitted to hospital, a strong relation existed between active peripartum migraine and vascular diagnoses during pregnancy. Diagnoses that were jointly associated with migraine codes during pregnancy (excluding pre-eclampsia) were stroke, myocardial infarction/<SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> disease, pulmonary embolus/venous thromboembolism, and hypertension, as well as pre-eclampsia/gestational hypertension, smoking, and diabetes. Because these data do not allow determination of which came first, migraine or the vascular condition, prospective studies of pregnant women are needed to explore this association further.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Symptoms of Chiari Malformation are broad involving several different systems. They include headache which can begin at the back of the head or the top to the temples. Headache is often made worse by straining, coughing, sneezing or laughing. Visual symptoms can occur with double vision, decreased peripheral vision, photophobia, visual loss or blind spots. Dizziness occurs frequently and is intermittent with vertigo, tinnitus, disequilibrium and loss of hearing, difficulty swallowing may occur with liquids or solids or a catching in the throat progressing to aspiration. Hoarseness may result or an inability to modulate voice when speaking or singing loudly. Persons may complain of arm or neck pain which is often made worse with fatigue or exertion. Tingling or numbness can result in the same areas as the pain, sometimes involving lower extremities and trunk. Problems walking may be described as an unsteadiness or listing to one side with spasticity of legs. Effect of Chiari malformation on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, episodes of rapid <SPAN class=hlght>heart</SPAN> rate, sleep apnea, blackout spells and hypertension. Abdominal symptoms may include nausea, abdominal pain or vomiting. General and cognitive symptoms include poor sleep with insomnia, fatigue and depression. (Pakzaban P and Wyler AR.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Prolongation of the electrocardiographic PR interval, known as first-degree atrioventricular block when the PR interval exceeds 200 milliseconds, is frequently encountered in clinical practice. Prospective, community-based cohort including 7575 individuals from the Framingham <SPAN class=hlght>Heart</SPAN> Study (mean age, 47 years; 54% women) who underwent routine 12-lead electrocardiography. The study cohort underwent prospective follow-up through 2007 from baseline examinations in 1968-1974. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the associations of PR interval with the incidence of arrhythmic events and death. At the baseline examination, 124 individuals had PR intervals longer than 200 milliseconds. For those with PR intervals longer than 200 milliseconds compared with those with PR intervals of 200 milliseconds or shorter, incidence rates per 10 000 person-years were 140 for AF, 59 for pacemaker implantation, and 334 for all-cause mortality. Corresponding absolute risk increases were 1.04% (AF), 0.53% (pacemaker implantation), and 2.05% (all-cause mortality) per year. Individuals with first-degree atrioventricular block had a 2-fold adjusted risk of AF, 3-fold adjusted risk of pacemaker implantation, and 1.4-fold adjusted risk of all-cause mortality. In conclusion, prolongation of the PR interval is associated with increased risks of AF, pacemaker implantation, and all-cause mortality. (Cheng S, Keyes MJ, Larson MG, et al.

<P class=synopsisdefault>Analyses from the Framingham <SPAN class=hlght>Heart</SPAN> Study have unequivocally demonstrated the prognostic value of echocardiographically detected LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy). First, echocardiographic LVH identifies a population at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Subjects with LVH are older, more obese, have higher blood pressures, and are more likely to have preexisting coronary disease and depressed LV systolic function (ejection fraction). Second, echocardiographic LVH predicts an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and death, even after adjustment for other major risk factors (age, blood pressure, pulse pressure, treatment for hypertension, cigarette use, diabetes, obesity, cholesterol profile, and electrocardiographic evidence of LVH). In otherwise healthy subjects followed for 4 years in whom LVH was defined as an LV mass adjusted for height of &gt;143 g/m in men and &gt;102 g/m in women, the relative risk of developing cardiovascular disease was 1.49 in men and 1.57 in women for each increment of 50 g/m in LV mass. This increment of LV mass was also associated with a relative risk of cardiovascular death of 1.73 in men and 2.12 in women and a relative risk of all-cause death of 1.49 in men and 2.01 in women. Increased LV mass is also associated with an increased risk for sudden cardiac death, which is more pronounced in men than in women. (Lorell BH and Carabello BA. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy.
