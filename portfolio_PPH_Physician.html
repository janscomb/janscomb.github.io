		<h3>Objective: Physician</h3>

		Hospital physicians have busy days. They see dozens of patients through-out their shift and they are responsible for the health of each of these patients. If a patient regresses, or isn't seen when they need a physician the most, difficulties can occur.

		<p>
		What this application does is give the physician a tool they can walk with, fill out in the elevator, or on break instead of finding a terminal in a room, a hallway or office. When a physician is doing their rounds, they need to know who to visit, have the data they need at hand, and make sure, with analytics that they can see results and history quickly. Seems pretty simple right?
		</p>

		<p>
		<strong>Goals:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Access to patient information on-the-go</li>
			<li>Quick-view analytics to spot regression</li>
			<li>Simplified rounding and patient tracking</li>
			<li>Patient diagnosis and notes</li>
			<li>Send and receive messages</li>

		<h3>Process</h3>

		Following our standardized team design process, we started with a discovery step which included interviewing the client, collecting a group of representatives and business spokespeople to conduct a workshop with. The workshop drives the direction and builds the foundation for what pain points and features to build towards. Personas are created to meet the user types learned about in the workshop and the design phase begins.
	
		<p>
		Starting with sketches and wireframes we ideated on portions of the UI featuring the features and set the pain points as goals to overcome. Empathizing with the personas created, we put ourselves in their place and act as them going through the ideation, playing devil's advocate to see if pain points were elievated, and at the same time finding how they'd find new features. The report of this execise was shared with the client along with the early sketches and wireframes.
		</p>

		<p>
		The next iteration upped the fidelity and polishing of the original sketches with included updates found from early exercises. This came as a clickable prototype that was used for our first round of testing with end users. The results of the testing was used to make changes to the prototype and apply them to the next level of fidelity. This was again tested, and a final round of iterations was made to the base and features, and the product was prepped for development. Development prep was done by taking the final prototype and writing specifications for all screens, animations and interactions. This UX / UI guide is handed off and used as a development tool and raleway to creating the final product.
